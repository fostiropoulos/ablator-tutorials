# ABLATOR Tutorials


You will need to install the latest version of ablator and jupyter-notebook to run the tutorials.

It is **highly** recommended that you set up a different virtual environment for ABLATOR to avoid inter-dependency issues that can arise from having several libraries installed in the same enviroment.

```bash
pip install ablator
```

to visualize your results you will need tensorflow installed. Please follow detailed instructions from the [official website]() for your specific system or simply run

```bash
pip install tensorflow
```

If you are using Kaggle or Google Colab Tensorflow should already be installed.


We provide tutorials for VSCODE development environment as well as Notebook such as Google Colab or Kaggle.
