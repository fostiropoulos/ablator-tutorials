# ABLATOR Tutorials

This repository contains examples of how to use ABLATOR to be used as inspiration on getting started with your project.


You will need to install the latest version of ablator and jupyter-notebook to run the tutorials.

It is **highly** recommended that you set up a different virtual environment for ABLATOR to avoid inter-dependency issues that can arise from having several libraries installed in the same environment.

```bash
pip install ablator
```

to visualize your results you will need tensorboard installed. Please follow detailed instructions from the [official website](https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard/get_started) for your specific system or simply run

```bash
pip install tensorboard
```

If you are using Kaggle or Google Colab Tensorboard should already be installed.

We provide tutorials for a local development environment (such as VSCODE) [HERE](vscode) as well as Notebook such as for use in Google Colab or Kaggle [HERE](notebooks).
