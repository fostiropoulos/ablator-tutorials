# Local Development Environment

A local development environment is most convenient for using a debugger.

We provide several examples

## Prototyping with LeNet

Code to get you started with Prototyping. It is written for a LeNet model and mnist dataset.

### [LeNet](prototyping)

## Training a ResNet

An ablation experiment using ResNet and MNIST. It is a more advanced tutorial of using an actual deep-learning model with a *real* dataset.

### [ResNet](resnet)


## Dashboard (Experimental)

Training a **mock** model on a **mock** dataset and writing results on a remote storage bucket `S3`.
